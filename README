# U.S. Grocery Price Analysis (2018–2024)
This project explores how grocery prices have changed across major U.S. regions from 2018 to 2024, 
with a focus on identifying regional inflation patterns and how specific food categories—such as dairy, produce,
and pantry staples—were affected before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The analysis uses two large public datasets (FMAP and SAPCE), processes them with Python (pandas, numpy), 
and visualizes key trends using matplotlib and seaborn. All work is contained in a well-documented Jupyter notebook for full reproducibility.

## Goals
* Examine year-over-year changes in grocery prices.
* Compare regional differences across major U.S. market areas.
* Identify categories most impacted by pandemic-era inflation.
* Produce interpretable visualizations that highlight long-term trends.

## Datasets Used
* FMAP: Monthly food price data with attributes such as year, month, category, and value.
* SAPCE: Regional economic indicators including geographic codes and descriptive metadata.

## Tools Used:
* Python
> * pandas
> * numpy
> * matplotlib, seaborn
* Jupyter notebook
* Github

## Key Takeaways:
* Grocery prices rose sharply after 2020, but not uniformly—some regions experienced higher inflation than others.
* Price behavior varies significantly across food categories, revealing supply chain and demand-related impacts.
* Python-based EDA provides a clear, replicable framework for exploring economic datasets.
